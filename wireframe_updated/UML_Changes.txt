Previously, an element could be a part of many different groups. Now, an element can only be a part of 1 group.

Added a method to remove elements from a group, as I didn't include it due to a copy/paste error.


I'm keeping the types for the Slider sublcass enums because it's essential for the GUI to know what it's drawing.

The behavior for all 3 types of Bars is the same, so this is the only way to differentiate between them.

Added a remove method to the Canvas as discussed in class. Also, the add/remove methods for Canvas return a Boolean, keeping them consistent with the other methods similar to it.

For the enums, I replaced all of them with just text denoting what type of element I have. 

Additionally, Superclasses have a protected constructor, so the subclasses can call them, but not from another outisde class.

This helps keep my code as locked down as possible. As always, all variables are as private as possible.
