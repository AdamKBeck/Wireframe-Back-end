1. Commenting self-use of over-ridable methods

2. For methods that override, start with "this implementation..."

3. Endline comments for data declarations

4. Comment input data for routines

5. Comment before if, for, etc.

6. Comment end of nested if, for, etc., if it's complicated

7. Describe a routine in 1-2 sentences

8. Comment name, date, version, etc. above each file

9. Comment why a file has more than 1 class (e.g. barricade for me)

10. Comment in/out paramater data for a routine if the paramaters are too long (this is just for clarity as the book suggests, I do not belive any routine has enough paramaters to do this)

11. Document global data, and routines that modify global data
